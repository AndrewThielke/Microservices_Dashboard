# System Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview

The System Monitoring Dashboard, designed by Andrew Thielke, is a comprehensive microservices-based application tailored to track and display various system metrics in real-time. This project aims to go beyond traditional monitoring systems by integrating advanced features like predictive analytics, real-time alerts, and historical data analysis. It's crafted to help system administrators and IT professionals monitor and manage system performance efficiently.

## Features

- Real-time Monitoring: Continuously track system metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network I/O.
- Security Monitoring: Detect and alert on security anomalies, unauthorized access attempts, and ensure compliance with security policies.
- *Historical Data Analysis: Analyze past performance for trend identification and capacity planning.
- *Predictive Analytics: Use machine learning to predict future system behavior and potential failures.
- *Configurable Alerts: Set up custom threshold-based alerts to be notified about critical system states.
- *User Authentication: Secure access to the dashboard with robust authentication mechanisms.
- *Scalable Architecture: Built using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Architecture

The application is structured into several microservices, each responsible for a different aspect of the system monitoring process. The services communicate over well-defined APIs and are orchestrated using Docker containers.

### Services

- Metric Collection Services : Collect different system metrics.
- Data Processing Service : Aggregates and processes metric data.
- Database Service : Stores historical metric data.
- Analytics and Reporting Service : Performs data analysis and generates reports.
- Authentication Service : Manages user authentication.
- API Gateway : Routes requests and handles load balancing.
- Frontend/UI Service : Provides the user interface.

### Data Flow

Data is collected through the Metric Collection Services, processed by the Data Processing Service, stored in the Database Service, and then utilized by the Analytics and Reporting Service to provide insights and alerts. The Frontend/UI Service displays the information to the users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Node.js (for the Frontend/UI Service)
- Any modern web browser

### Installation

Clone the repository:

- git clone <https://github.com/yourgithubusername/system-monitoring-dashboard.git>

1. Navigate to the project directory:
*cd system-monitoring-dashboard*
2. Build and run the services using Docker Compose:
*docker-compose up --build*

## Usage

Once the services are up and running, you can access the dashboard through your web browser: <http://localhost:3000>
Log in using your credentials to view and interact with the system metrics.
