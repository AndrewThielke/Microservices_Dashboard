1. Requirements Specification
    - Define Key Metrics: 
        - Decide on the metrics that are most crucial for monitoring. This might include CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O, response times, and error rates.
        Defined Layer One Key Metrics: 
            - CPU Usage: Monitor the percentage of CPU utilized by processes. This can be broken down further into user space and kernel space usage.
            - Memory Usage: Track the total memory usage, including RAM and swap usage, which helps in understanding if there's memory pressure.
            - Disk I/O: Monitor the input/output operations on the disk. Metrics can include read and write speeds, number of reads/writes, and disk utilization percentage.
            - Network I/O: Measure the data being sent and received over the network. This includes bandwidth usage, packet transmission rates, and error rates in data transmission.
            - Response Times: For web servers or services, monitor the response time for each request to see how quickly the system serves requests.
            - Error Rates: Track the rate of errors in the system, which could include application errors, system errors, and network errors.
            - Process Count: Keep a count of the total number of running processes and threads, which can indicate system load and help in troubleshooting performance issues.
            - System Load Average: Measure the average load on the system over a period of time, which helps in identifying trends in system usage.
            - Patch Status: Track the patch status of applications and operating systems to ensure they are up to date and not susceptible to known vulnerabilities.
        Defined Layer Two Key Metrics:
            - Login Attempts: Monitor successful and failed login attempts to detect potential unauthorized access or brute-force attacks.
            - Network Traffic Anomalies: Use algorithms to detect unusual network traffic patterns that could indicate a DDoS attack or network probe.
            - File Integrity Monitoring: Track changes to system files and directories to detect modifications that might signify a breach or introduction of malware.
            - Port Scanning Activities: Detect scans on network ports which could indicate an attacker trying to find vulnerabilities to exploit.
            - Encryption Status: Monitor the encryption status of data at rest and in transit to ensure compliance with security policies.
            - Antivirus Alerts: Integrate with antivirus software to get real-time alerts about detected threats.
            - Firewall Logs: Analyze firewall logs to identify rejected connections and rule violations that may point to attempted security breaches.
    
    - Identify Additional Features: 
        - Consider adding features like historical data analysis, alerts for threshold breaches, and predictive analytics based on trend data.

            - Trend Analysis: Provide graphical representations of historical data to identify trends over time for each metric.
            - Comparison Tools: Allow users to compare historical performance across different times or events to identify patterns or effects of changes.
        2. Alerts for Threshold Breaches
            - Configurable Thresholds: Enable users to set custom thresholds for any metric, beyond which an alert will be triggered.
            - Alert Escalation: Implement an escalation system where alerts can be escalated to different levels of severity based on predefined criteria.
        3. Predictive Analytics
            - Failure Prediction: Use machine learning models to predict potential system failures by analyzing patterns from historical data.
            - Resource Forecasting: Predict future resource needs based on trends, helping in capacity planning and resource allocation.
        4. Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting
            - Live Data Feed: Implement a live data feed for real-time monitoring of system metrics.
            - Customizable Dashboards: Allow users to create custom dashboards tailored to their needs, choosing which metrics to display prominently.
        5. Security Enhancements
            - Anomaly Detection: Integrate advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in behavior that could indicate a security issue.
            - Security Audits: Schedule regular security audits and display the results and recommendations on the dashboard.
        6. Automated Remediation
            - Script Actions: Provide options for setting up automated scripts that execute predefined actions when certain thresholds are breached, such as restarting a service or backing up data.
            - Self-Healing Systems: Develop capabilities for the system to automatically attempt to correct detected issues without human intervention.
        7. Integration Capabilities
            - API Integration: Develop APIs that allow for integration with other tools and systems within the infrastructure for a unified monitoring solution.
